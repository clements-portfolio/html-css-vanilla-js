This basic JavaScript game allows a user to guess the value of a randomly selected number. The user may guess multiple times and is provided with the correct answer if they guess correctly or run out of guesses. This project leverages Skeleton CSS for quick styling and shows the following concepts:
  - Vanilla JS
    - DOM Manipulation
    - Event Listening
    - Form Validation
    - Event Delegation
  - Skeleton CSS
